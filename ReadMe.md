# Python Practice Code Repository  

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts created during my studies at the university. The scripts were developed as part of coursework and self-development exercises to enhance my understanding of Python programming and problem-solving techniques.  

## Repository Overview  

The repository includes the following scripts, covering a wide range of Python topics:  

1. **`Branching Structure in Python (Selection & Looping).py`**: Demonstrates control flow structures such as conditional statements and loops.  
2. **`Data Types in Python.py`**: Explores Python's built-in data types and their applications.  
3. **`Intro to GUI Dev.py`**: An introduction to creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.  
4. **`Making Program Interactive.py`**: Focuses on interactive programming, including user input and output.  
5. **`What is Python.py`**: A script discussing the basics of Python, its features, and benefits.  
6. **`CSC_201_Asg.py`**: An assignment file related for the CSC 201 (Computer Programming - Python) coursework.  
7. **`Files.py`**: Demonstrates file handling operations like reading and writing files in Python.  
8. **`List.py`**: Explores list data structures and their operations.  
9. **`Orange.txt`**: An accompanying text file for a specific script.  
10. **`Python_Bitwise_Operation.py`**: Covers bitwise operations and their use in Python programming.  
11. **`Strings.py`**: Focuses on string manipulation and related functions.  
12. **`Test Field.py`**: Appears to be a test or practice file for experimenting with Python code.  
13. **`Tuples.py`**: Discusses tuple data structures and their properties.  
14. **`Week 5 Asg.py`**: Another coursework-related assignment script.  

Additionally, the repository contains a `venv` folder, representing a Python virtual environment, and an `.idea` folder. The PyCharm, during development.  

## Key Details  

- The scripts reflect foundational and intermediate-level Python programming concepts learned during coursework.  
- They cover practical use cases like file handling, data structures, interactive programming, and more.  

## Notes  

- This repository serves as an archive of my early programming efforts and progress in Python.  
- Future updates may include refinements or additional notes to enhance readability and utility for educational purposes.
